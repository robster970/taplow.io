                            <p>Whilst the under 45s and their young families are in a minority in Taplow parish, it is still a substantial group. How does Taplow parish council manage to do so little for this younger demography? The council has little to no representation of this age group.<br />Source: ONS 2011 Census data. 29/12/15</p>

                            <p>It is not surprising that with higher levels of education, employment and retirement that Taplow parish owns more of its own property. What is striking is the significant uplift in outright ownership. This could be associated with high net worth individuals residing in the parish but is more likely to be associated with high number of people over 45 who are likely to have paid their mortgages off.<br />Source: ONS 2011 Census data. 29/12/15</p>

                            <p>Supporting the premise that the residents of Taplow parish are higher earners (for those that are working anyway), you would expect to see a higher proportion of residents with degrees and professional qualifications. This bears to be true by quite a jump with Taplow being 13% larger than the national figures for those with degrees.<br />Source: ONS 2011 Census data. 29/12/15</p>

                            <p>Taplow definitely works harder than the national average (+5%) and the increased number of people in the parish who are retired is 3% greater than the national figures. This would indicate that the amount of money in the area is higher than the norm but this would only be true if those in employment and those that have retired are, or have been, higher earners. This increased income may be offset by having to service the debt associated with higher property costs, especially for those that are still working and paying down mortgages..<br />Source: ONS 2011 Census data. 29/12/15</p>

							<h3>#3 Under 45s in the minority</h3>
							<p>When the statistics for one group of people look broadly similar to the statistics for another group of people, scatter plots like the one above usually look like a nice diagonal line. As you can see the large cluster of dots in the left hand corner represent the large disparity in numbers for those under the age of 45 in Taplow compared to the national figures collected in the census.<br />Source: ONS 2011 Census data. 29/12/15</p>

							<h3>#2 Less children, more adults</h3>
							<p>By breaking down the under 45's into adults and children it can be seen that both populations are approximately 6% below the national average. However it seems fair to say that if there were 6% more adults with families, there would likely be 6% more children in the parish too, the proportions being broadly equal. This would indicate that the problem with families moving into the area is associated with affordable and available housing stock. As increasing the housing stock in the area is almost impossible due the parish councils attitudes to enhancing the area, an increase in this demography can only come about if members of the parish without children leave the area.<br />Source: ONS 2011 Census data. 29/12/15</p>

							<h3>#1 Skewed and aging population</h3>
							<p>Taplow goes against the national norms in a worrying trend that indicates that the middle aged and elderly form the majority of residents in the parish. Those under the age of 45 including their young families are 12% under-represented by comparisson to United Kingdon national figures from the 2011 census. Conversely those over 45 are 12% over-represented by the same 2011 census figures. This is not a 'young' village by any measure.<br />Source: ONS 2011 Census data. 29/12/15</p>
