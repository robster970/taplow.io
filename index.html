The top 5 words used on the website are  Taplow (114), road (107), granted (94), parish (84) and council (67). To summarise, it talks mainly about itself and the local roads.

How does Taplow Parish Council manage to do so little for this younger demography? The council has little to no representation of this age group, which may be something to consider.

Taplow has done well in the 20 years since records started. The advent of Crossrail might give the area the boost it needs for continued house price inflation, even if interest is waning locally.

                            <p>Historically you can see that the number of property transactions varies between 60 (2011) and 136 (2014). As there are 791 households on the UK Electoral register for Taplow, it implies that between 7.6% and 17.2% of Taplow Parish households churn every year. This has been skewed by the increase in housing stock from Cliveden Gages implying there is churn when in fact it is just new supply. However it looks like figures have settled down once again. It would not be a suprise to see high numbers appear again with the increase in housing stock coming from the Berkeley Homes development which has just started. What will be interesting to see is whether over-supply of housing is likely to flatten house price growth now. Source: UK Land registry 2015. 30/12/15</p>

This indicates that the amount of money in the area is higher than the norm. However, this would only be true if those in employment and those that have retired are, or have been, higher earners. This increased income may be offset by having to service the debt associated with higher property costs, especially for those that are still working and paying down mortgages.
